# NYC Adoptable Pet Search Command Line Application

For this project, we utilized the [Petfinder API](https://www.petfinder.com/) to allow our users to search by querying the API and save adoptable pets based on different sets of criteria to a Sqlite3 Database using ActiveRecord.

There are two user search flows:
1. A user selects a location in the NYC area which returns a list of up to 25 shelters in the desired borough. The user then selects a shelter from the list to view all pets available at that location. The user can then choose to view more information about a specific pet, view an image of the pet, and finally, decide whether they would like to save the pet to their personal database.
2. A user can select a type of pet for which they would like to search. They have the option to select an additional criteria to narrow their search (Age, Sex, Size, Breed) or can simply view 25 pets in the New York area. From this list, the user can select a pet for which they would like to see more information, view an image of the pet, and finally, decide whether they would like to save the pet to their personal database.

The user can also access their saved pets after logging in and authenticating:
1. From the main menu, a user can select to view their saved data. If they have previously saved a pet or multiple pets from one of the two search flows above, the saved pet and associated shelter information can be displayed in one of two tables:
  * Saved Pets Table - Here, a user can view all saved pets and associated pet details, including age, sex, size, breed(s), shelter, and contact information.
  * Shelters for Saved Pets Table - Here, a user can view all shelters and corresponding location and contact information for all pets they have saved.
